General Notes:
The dataset contains both continuous (e.g., height, weight) and discrete variables (e.g., age, grip strength), along with a binary categorical variable (frailty).
The data seems to be about physical characteristics (height, weight, grip strength) and includes a frailty indicator that could be useful in health, aging, or fitness studies.
